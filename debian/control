Description: Cross-platform and multi-threaded benchmark tool
 SysBench is a modular, cross-platform and multi-threaded benchmark tool for
 evaluating OS parameters that are important for a system running a database
 under intensive load.
 .
 The idea of this benchmark suite is to quickly get an impression about system
 performance without setting up complex database benchmarks or even without
 installing a database at all.
 .
 Current features allow to test the following system parameters:
 .
  * file I/O performance
  * scheduler performance
  * memory allocation and transfer speed
  * POSIX threads implementation performance
  * database server performance (OLTP benchmark)
